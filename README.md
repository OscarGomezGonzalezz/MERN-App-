# TODO App

## Getting started
First of all, remove dependencies on both backend, and frontend and install yours:
- rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
- npm install

For running mongoDB in the cloud (mongoDB Atlas):
1. Create a cluster
2. create user and password(registered in the .env file)
3. choose the driver connection 

But as we have to run the database locally:
1. Install mongoDB
2. brew start mongodb-community
3. For checking the connection in shell: mongosh "mongodb+srv://cluster0.7m91o.mongodb.net/" --apiVersion 1 --username oscar

IMPORTANT: WHEN TESTING IT WITH POSTMAN:
Authorization: {token} <--- WITHOUT ADDING "Token" OR "Bearer" before the token itself

Before inizialising the backend, we have to create a .env file, inside the /backend folder, with our secret key: JWT_SECRET=example
For security reasons, add this file to the .gitignore

Now, we can run the backend: 
1. cd backend
2. nodemon server.js



Now, backend is ready for receiving requests from the frontend, so we run it with:
1. cd ../frontend
2. npm start

## Test and Deploy

Use the built-in continuous integration in GitLab.
